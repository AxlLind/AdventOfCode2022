# AdventOfCode2022 :christmas_tree:
Solutions to all 25 AoC 2022 in Rust :crab: Using less than 100 lines per day, and with a total runtime of just over 1 second.

I really liked 2022, it was a good AoC year. It was the year I finally reached my goal of hitting the top 100, 25th place on [day 19](./src/bin/19.rs)!

## Usage
```sh
cargo run --release --bin DAY # run a specific day
cargo run --release           # run all days
```
