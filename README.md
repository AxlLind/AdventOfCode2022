# AdventOfCode2022 :christmas_tree:
Solutions to all 25 AoC 2022 in Rust :crab: Using less than 100 lines per day, and with a total runtime of `0.82` seconds.

I really liked 2022, it was a good AoC year. It was the year I finally reached my goal of hitting the top 100, 25th place on [day 19](./src/bin/19.rs)!

For execution time of each solution, see [timings.md](./timings.md).

## Usage
```sh
cargo run --release --bin DAY # run a specific day
cargo run --release           # run all days
```
